# Trend Data

The percentual changes for each iteration of currency system

for each defined currency, there is an array of numbers

```JSON
[
    [
        0, -2, 15,
    ],
    [
        0, 10, -5,
    ]
]
```

> In the previous example, there would be two currencies, and three minutes would have passed, as there are three iterations
